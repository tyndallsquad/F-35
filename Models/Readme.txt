INSTALLATION GUIDE -

1) Extract all files into your CFS2 or CFS2000 root folder. The necessary sub-folders will be created automatically.


** This aircraft will not work in FS98 OR CFS1.

Note on PANELS : an alternative panel.cfg is supplied which is for FS2000 use only. This will allow use of the GPS facility. Just rename the existing file to panel CFS.cfg and change panel FS2K.cfg to panel.cfg.

Note on SOUNDS : CFS2 does not use the normal default Lear45 sounds. Either install the Learjet from FS2K or edit this aircraft's sound.cfg (with Notepad) to point at some jet sounds you already have. The Skyhawk sounds from the 'Jump Jet' add-on are particularly good.

Note on CFS2 WEAPONS : extract the seperate Weapons zipfile into the root of CFS2. Shift-3 selects the weapons in the game. 3 fires them.
